## Overview  

The **ComSense** application is a cutting-edge, Python-based tool designed to help content creators, marketers, and analysts unlock valuable insights from YouTube and Twitter comments. By harnessing the power of technologies such as the **YouTube Data API v3**, **OpenAI's GPT API**, **Streamlit**, **Gemini Pro model**, and advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this app offers a seamless and interactive platform for analyzing and summarizing comments at scale.  

The tool enables users to input a YouTube video URL or fetch Twitter comments and analyze them comprehensively. The application extracts insights such as sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and comment summarization to empower users with actionable data for content improvement, audience engagement, and strategic decision-making.  

## Features  

### 1. **YouTube and Twitter Comment Retrieval**  
   - **YouTube Comments**: The YouTube Data API v3 fetches comments from a specified video URL. It handles large comment datasets by retrieving multiple pages of comments efficiently.  
   - **Twitter Comments**: Users can share a tweet URL and select the number of comments to fetch for analysis. This feature ensures targeted and efficient retrieval of tweet interactions.  

### 2. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Comments are classified into **Positive**, **Negative**, and **Neutral** categories, offering a clear view of audience sentiment.  
   - Sentiment scores are computed using advanced NLP models, including the **Gemini Pro model**, to ensure high accuracy and contextual understanding.  

### 3. **Comment Summarization**  
   - Using the **OpenAI GPT API** and **Gemini Pro model**, the application generates concise summaries of YouTube and Twitter comments.  
   - Summaries encapsulate the core themes and sentiments discussed, providing a snapshot of audience engagement without manual effort.  

### 4. **Keyword Extraction and Topic Modeling**  
   - Frequent keywords and phrases are extracted using NLP algorithms to highlight trending topics.  
   - Advanced topic modeling reveals deeper insights into audience interests and concerns, helping users align their strategies accordingly.  

### 5. **Interactive Visualization**  
   - The **Streamlit** interface presents sentiment distributions, keyword trends, and comment summaries in an engaging, user-friendly format.  
   - Visualizations, powered by **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**, include pie charts, bar graphs, and word clouds for enhanced interpretability.
